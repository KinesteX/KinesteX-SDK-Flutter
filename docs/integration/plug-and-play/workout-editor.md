# Admin Workout Editor Embedded View

The Admin Workout Editor is a customizable embedded view for creating and managing workouts and exercises. As users interact with the editor, your application will receive events that you can handle to trigger custom logic.

---

## Integration Example

This example shows how to create the admin workout editor view in your application.

```dart
KinesteXAIFramework.createAdminWorkoutEditor(
  apiKey: apiKey,
  companyName: company,
  userId: userId,
  // Use an organization name to differentiate between different orgs.
  // If you don't plan to use multiple orgs, you can use your company name.
  organization: "your_organization_name",
  isShowKinestex: showKinesteX,
  // OPTIONAL: show/hide content on the admin dashboard
  customQueries: { 
            "hidePlansTab": true, // will hide the plans tabs in the dashboard
            "tab": "workouts", // will default to workouts tab. You can choose "exercises" or "plans" as well
            "isSelectableMenu": true // will show select Button on workout, exercises, and plans cards, clicking on which will trigger ..._selected event (see below)
   },
  isLoading: ValueNotifier<bool>(false),
  onMessageReceived: (message) {
    handleWebViewMessage(message);
  },
);
```
